# FoodWasteAndData
# Title
Development of a Continental Food Demand and Wastage Data Application (Web-based)

## Introduction
Today, the world faces uncertainity of food security largely due to food wastage along the whole food supply chain. 
Over a third of all food produced (around 2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year. One year of this occurs in the food production stage. Bostion Consulting
Group (BCG) estimates this wasted food is worht $230 billion.

Researchers estimate the lost food calories from food waste amount to roughly 24% of the total available food
calories. To put this in perspective, the UN reports that about a third of the global population, mostly in developing countries
and low income countries, didn't have enough access to food in 2020, an increase of 320 million people from the previous year.

According to UCU Mukono, food wastage makes up 65-79% of solid waste in landfills in Uganda causing environemental and health probleems.
Globally, the problem is predicted to increase causing higher global food insecurity.

## Description
This project seeks to create a data tool to address Global Food Insecurity  through;
<ul>
<li>Analysis of world datasets on Food Demand and Wastage in Africa</li>
<li>Visualize World Food Waste and Demand Data</li>
<li>Predict food demands and waste in Africa</li>
</ul>

## Core Features
<ul>
<li> Analysis and Visualization of Food Demand and Waste Data</li>
<li> Food Demand and Waste Predictions</li>
</ul>

## Scope
This project shall address Africa Food Insecurity through mitigation of Food Waste
at the following levels.
<ul>
<li>Continental level (Specifically Africa)</li>
<li>Regional level (for example East Africa, Southern Africa, etc) </li>
<li>Country level (for example Uganda, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, etc) </li>
<li>Country regional level (for example Central Region of Uganda, Eastern Region,) </li>
</ul>

  Summary of data sources
The dataset contains information on food loss across various commodities, regions, and supply stages. 
General Information
•	Total Records: 25,416
•	Number of Columns: 18
Key Attributes: 
	m49_code and country: Numerical and textual identifiers for countries.
	cpc_code and commodity: Codes and names of commodities.
	year: The year of data collection.
	loss_percentage and loss_quantity: Percentage and quantity of losses recorded.
	activity and food_supply_stage: Descriptions of the activities and supply stages where losses occurred.
	method_data_collection and reference: Methods used for data collection and associated references.
	Other columns include region, cause_of_loss, treatment, sample_size, url, and notes.
Sample Data
A snippet of the data includes:
•	Commodity: Rice, milled (e.g., Myanmar, 2015)
•	Loss Percentage: Ranges (e.g., 1.78%, 11.77%)
•	Food Supply Stage: Typically storage.
•	Cause of Loss: Often rodents, with varying treatments (e.g., trapping/no trapping).
•	Data Collection Method: Controlled experiments.
Data Completeness
•	Some columns, such as loss_quantity, treatment, and cause_of_loss, have significant missing values.
•	Core columns like country, commodity, year, and loss_percentage are fully populated.
